# Recycler-View-Data-Binding-Example

SHOW EXAMPLES OF DATA BINDING THROUGH COMBINING MULTIPLE EXAMPLES AS ONE
I wanted to show some examples of using data binding on a regular layout and a recycler view list item layout.
I also wanted to give an example using binding adapters.

You will find some sample code displaying how to use data binding with a recycler view. 


WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR CODE WORKS

// add code to -> app: build.gradle 

plugin: id 'kotlin-kapt'

buildFeatures {
    dataBinding true
}

// convert layouts to data binding layouts

Right click on parent view 
-> press "Show Context Actions" 
-> press "Convert to data binding"
